The project involved using Terraform to deploy a Virtual Cloud Network (VCN) to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. The VCN was created to provide a secure and isolated network environment for the project's resources. The project's infrastructure was defined in code using Terraform, which allowed for the automated deployment of resources with ease.
The VCN deployment included setting up subnet security lists,Terraform modules were used to simplify the configuration process and enforce best practices.
